# Switching model APIs

Both computer and Cloudflare installations can use different models through
OpenRouter, or a different **OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API**. Your existing
installation keeps its current defaults until you configure a replacement.

This is protocol compatibility, not a promise that every model produces good
learning material. The synthetic integration test substitutes a different API
address, key and model throughout upload, extraction, paired quiz publication,
study, semantic answer grading and restart. It makes no paid provider calls.

## Before choosing a model

Check your provider's documentation for HTTPS Chat Completions, bearer API keys,
`messages`, `max_tokens`, non-streaming responses, and `response_format` with
`json_object` and strict `json_schema`. Responses must include a request `id`,
`choices[0].finish_reason: "stop"`, and JSON text in `message.content`.
If usage is reported, token counts must be nonnegative integers. The older
learning-generation endpoint additionally requires matching prompt, completion
and total token counts. Image workflows also need image inputs using `image_url`
with data URLs. Choose models with sufficient context and output limits; the
checked-in limits were selected for the default models.

Native Anthropic Messages, Gemini generateContent and OpenAI Responses protocols
need a compatible gateway or a separate adapter. A chat subscription is not an
API service. Non-OpenRouter endpoints receive no OpenRouter `provider` or
`reasoning` extensions. Provider-specific reasoning controls need an adapter.

## 1. Choose the endpoint, key and general models

For **computer mode**, add these lines to your private `.env.local`, replacing
every example with your provider's actual values:

```dotenv
LLM_CHAT_ENDPOINT="https://YOUR_PROVIDER/v1/chat/completions"
LLM_API_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY"
LLM_MODEL="YOUR_GENERAL_MODEL_ID"
LLM_GRADING_MODEL="YOUR_GRADING_MODEL_ID"
```

`LLM_MODEL` handles source classification and the older learning generator.
`LLM_GRADING_MODEL` handles semantic answer grading and image-association decisions
through the same chat endpoint. It can use the same model ID. Its probabilities
are model judgments, not calibrated Jev probabilities; the existing acceptance
thresholds remain product choices. Exact answers and choice checks stay deterministic.

For **Cloudflare mode**, put the three non-secret values in the `vars` object
of your private `wrangler.self-host.jsonc`. Store the key separately:

```sh
npx wrangler@4.151.1 secret put LLM_API_KEY --config wrangler.self-host.jsonc
```

A different provider requires its own `LLM_API_KEY`; the app will never send your
OpenRouter key to a replacement provider. Use an exact HTTPS endpoint without
embedded credentials, query parameters or fragments. Redirects fail rather than
forwarding source content to a different URL. Keys remain on the server.

To change only models while staying on OpenRouter, keep your existing key and
endpoint. Set `LLM_MODEL` for classification/older generation; optionally set
`LLM_GRADING_MODEL` to replace Jev. Complete the workflow-role step below too.

## 2. Choose the four workflow-role models

Open each file in `agent-config/`:

- `rights-assessor.yaml`
- `knowledge-scraper.yaml`
- `question-generator.yaml`
- `question-evaluator.yaml`

In its `model` section, set `name` to the model ID your chosen API accepts.
Set `provider` to `openai-compatible` for a replacement API, or keep `openrouter`
for OpenRouter. These role models handle the main extraction/publication workflow;
setting `LLM_MODEL` alone does not replace them. You may use one model for all
four roles, or choose different models at the same endpoint. There is no fixed
vendor/model allowlist. Keep the rest of each file unless you understand its limits.

**Computer:** restart with `deno task start:local`. Canonical configuration
digests are recalculated automatically.

**Cloudflare:** print your exact canonical digests:

```sh
node scripts/agent-config-digests.mjs
```

Copy the printed JSON into `KNOWLEDGE_WORKFLOW_CONFIG_DIGESTS` in your private
config as its escaped JSON string, following the existing value's format. For
example, each inner `"` becomes `\"`. Keep every role and complete SHA256 value.
Then run the build, dry run and deployment commands from [Cloudflare setup](SELF_HOSTING.md).
The command prints configuration hashes, never API keys.

Let active source-processing runs finish before changing provider/models. A run
with an old configuration digest fails validation after YAML changes; do not
delete learner data to fix it. Start a new processing run using the new configuration.

## 3. Optional semantic-search reranking

Reranking uses a separate protocol. Configure a compatible rerank API with:

```dotenv
RERANK_ENDPOINT="https://YOUR_PROVIDER/v2/rerank"
RERANK_API_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_RERANK_KEY"
RERANK_MODEL="YOUR_RERANK_MODEL_ID"
```

It must accept `model`, `query`, `documents` and `top_n`, and return `results`
with unique input `index` values and `relevance_score` numbers from 0 to 1.
Use `.env.local` in computer mode; use Cloudflare `vars` for endpoint/model and
`wrangler secret put RERANK_API_KEY --config wrangler.self-host.jsonc` for the key.
Changing only the OpenRouter rerank model requires just `RERANK_MODEL`.

With a replacement chat API and no separate reranker, optional semantic search
is unavailable; keyword search and the learning pipeline still work. No request
falls back to the maintainer's services. Firecrawl, acquisition, discovery and
notifications retain their own documented protocols; a chat API does not replace them.

## Check your installation

Process a short document you own, confirm Feed has its knowledge cards, study a
batch, and answer a quiz. Try a correct paraphrase in a blank answer to exercise
semantic grading. Confirm your provider dashboard shows the intended models and
charges. If a provider rejects a request, check its required format, model access,
limits and API key; validation failures are reported rather than accepted as success.
